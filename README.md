###DESCRIPTION:

Trashman Begins falls under the adventure and education genres. This game aims to bring awareness about pollution and the resulting climate change. A subtle theme throughout the game is the sense of urgency. By including the time mechanic, the player must hurry to alleviate the pollution problem before significant damage is done. Like in the real world, we must be conscious to start changing our habits now to better the future of our planet. The target audience is people who know little about climate change but would like to know more. There are facts that the player would find interesting and would encourage them to look more into how they can alter their behaviour and help make change in the real world.

You will meet Miku at Antarctica Town and she will asks you to help her rescuing penguins. Talk to her after each level to get your reward (points) for every penguin you save.
4. You will then receive a TURBINE BLADE after you're done helping her and return to Tibbers Town. Talk to Alice and you will then asked to head West to Aohari Town.
5. After traveling through three maps, you will arrive at Aohari City. Talk to Reki and she will asks you to help her destroy the Corporation by meeting her North of Aohari City. You will then have to pass through 3 puzzles to get to the end stage where you destroy a machine by throwing trash at it. Talk to Reki afterward to get your rewards.
7. You will then return to Tibbers Town and receive your last mission of going East to Gobi Town and talk to Mimi there.
8. You will travel through three maps before getting to Gobi Town. Make sure to explore the map and talk to Ariel to get your Turbine Blades. When you arrive at Gobi Town, Mimi will welcome you and tell you to head North to fix the broken turbines. 
9. After fixing the turbines, you will be sent back to headquarters and that is where your ending will trigger based on your performance.

######ENDINGS:
1. Best ending: "You helped saving the world." This ending is quite hard to get, especially for first time players. You have to finish this game quickly within a short amount of time. 
2. Okay ending: "You did your job.. nothing really changed though." Not hard to get.
3. Bad ending: "You did not help anything and the world is in bad shape... probably going to be destroyed." You can trigger this ending if you took too long.
